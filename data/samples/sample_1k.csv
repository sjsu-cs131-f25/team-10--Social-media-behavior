What you mean is that it wasn't a failure of the technology itself. However, this was absolutely an engineering failure. Engineering isn't technology. It is technology and its intersection with society. That's why in many places (such as Canada, where I practice), one needs to be a licensed professional, not just have an engineering degree. Ensuring that the proper checks are applied to technology that could harm the public is central to engineering. Indeed, in British Columbia, the number 1 obligation of professional engineers is ""Protect the Public Good"". If the engineers responsible for maintaining this escalator had followed the proper practices, this would never have happened.",0,,UCA4ARndzW1hXPzCF14M0VxA

It is truly astonishing that almost all European governments are completely dependent on the US software companies, who are obliged under the Cloud Act to hand over any data the US government requests, regardless where in the world it is stored. In other words, US government has the capability to read the internal emails in our governments and companies that use for instance Microsoft Exhange/365, or Gmail, or any other US provider. Europe does not have many big software players, but it does have a very large public sector and if they cared to buy European, it would foster a much more competitive European software industry. Consumers want it too, we like having less techno-fudalist rules and regulations compared to the US and welcome things like GDPR - and we suspect US companies are less likely to actually comply - but we simply don't have European alternatives in most cases.
