However, I think we still need to be concerned about RSA, since Shor's algorithm WILL make it obsolete if we're still using it when quantum computers become practical! Perhaps for now we need to switch from RSA to elliptic curve cryptosystems or some other alternative for which no exponential quantum speedup is known. Another thing we should do is implement quantum encryption algorithms as soon as practical quantum computers become available, so even the new quantum computers won't be able to break them.",0,,UCkYkmVzVREA9laqEGkLnMYA
